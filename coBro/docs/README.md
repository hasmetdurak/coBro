CoBro Stream 

Hey there! I'm an indie dev pouring my heart into CoBro Stream, a game-changing live streaming platform that delivers 1080p, 4K video with sub-100ms latencyâ€”all straight from your browser! Built with WebRTC and VP9, this is my dream to make real-time streaming accessible for everyone, from gamers to sports fans to virtual concert-goers. No hefty server costs, no downloads, just pure, low-latency magic. 
Why CoBro Stream?
I got tired of laggy streams ruining the vibe of live events. Whether it's a clutch moment in a game or a goal in a soccer match, every millisecond counts. So, I built CoBro Stream to be:

Blazing Fast: <100ms latency for near-instant playback.
Peer-to-Peer: Uses WebRTC to distribute streams, slashing server load.
High Quality: VP9 codec for crisp 1080p (up to 4K/8K) with efficient bandwidth.
Browser-Based: No apps to installâ€”just fire up cobrostream.com.
Indie Spirit: Built by one dev, powered by the community.

Think of it as the lovechild of Twitch and Zoom, but leaner, meaner, and way faster. Perfect for sports, gaming, concerts, or any live event where timing is everything.
Features 

Ultra-Low Latency Streaming: Watch or broadcast with <100ms delay.
P2P Architecture: Peers share the load, making it scalable and cost-effective.
VP9 Encoding: High-quality video at low bandwidth (1080p at 8-12 Mbps).
SaaS Experience: Stream or watch directly in the browser with React.js + Tailwind CSS.
Secure: AES-256 encryption, JWT authentication, and WebRTC's DTLS.
Dockerized Backend: Node.js + Redis for real-time peer discovery and signaling.
Flexible Plans:
Viewers: Free (Pro, 720p/1080p) or Premium ($9.90/mo, unlimited quality).
Broadcasters: Pro ($29.90/mo, 720p), Premium ($49.90/mo, 1080p), Enterprise ($99.90/mo, 4K/8K).



Tech Stack ðŸ› 

Frontend: React.js, Tailwind CSS, WebRTC, FFmpeg.js (for browser-based VP9 encoding).
Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO (WebRTC signaling), Redis (peer discovery).
Infra: Docker, Kubernetes-ready for cloud deployment (AWS/Google Cloud).
Protocol: Custom UDP-based RTP with FEC and selective retransmission for reliability.
